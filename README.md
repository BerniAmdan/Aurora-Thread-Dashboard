# Aurora-Thread Sales performance, Customer behaviour, and Product trend Analysis (Interactive Dashboard created using Power BI)
## Project Objectives
A fashion boutique aiming to stay ahead in competition by leveraging data-driven strategies but lacks advanced analytics capabilities, hampering its ability to make timely and well-informed business decisions. Data for 2024 across its 3 stores has been analysed to help it identify trends and remove inefficiencies in performance tracking.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/BerniAmdan/Aurora-Thread-Dashboard/blob/main/Aurora%20Threads%20Data.xlsx">Dataset<a/>

## Issues addressed
- Which are the top-selling product categories?
- What are the top 10 products that contributed most to revenue?
- What is the sales trend over time?
- What is the gender-based sales distribution?
- Which payment types are most popular?
- List of customers with their revenue and quantity purchased.

## Process
- Used Power Query editor to check data integrity, apply appropriate data type, and sort the needed columns.
- Used M Language for product categorisation and distribution into new columns.
- Used DAX calculated column and measure to calculate total quantity sold, revenue, transaction weekday, and average revenue.
- Built visualisation and implemented slicers for dashboard interaction.

  ## Recommendations
- Investigate revenue decline trend: Review marketing activity, stock levels, and promotional effectiveness during this period; Assess customer behavior data (e.g., website traffic, cart abandonment, complaints); and perform root-cause analysis where there are external factors (e.g. supply issues, post-holiday slowdown)
- Strengthening revenue drivers like Accessories: Allocate more marketing spend and inventory to Accessories; Explore bundling Accessories with lower-performing categories (e.g., bundle with Footwear); and identify top-performing SKUs within Accessories and expand or promote them.
- Revitalising low performers: Assess product design, pricing, and placement—are they appealing to your target market?; Offer time-limited discounts or style refresh campaigns; and solicit customer feedback on product satisfaction or barriers to purchase.
- Leveraging product-level revenue range: Analyze the price-to-revenue relationship: Are lower-revenue products underpriced or under-promoted? Consider phasing out bottom performers or repositioning them, and upselling from lower-tier to higher-performing items with tiered pricing.
- Strengthening weekday demand: Introducing weekday-only offers or loyalty point multipliers; running email/social campaigns targeted at mid-week engagement; and optimizing operating hours or fulfillment for weekday patterns.
- Setting up real-time revenue monitoring using dashboards: Set alerts for rapid drops (like the Jan 3–5 event) to allow for quicker reaction; track promotional effectiveness and conversion rates by product category.
